Title: Feature 2: Real-Time LLM-powered KPIs for Instant Supplier Insights
Content:
Description: Real-time access to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to each supplier, powered by LLM-based analysis.
How It Works:
The system tracks and aggregates key supplier metrics like on-time delivery, quality, cost reduction, and sustainability performance.
LLMs process this data and present it to stakeholders in an easy-to-understand format, with contextual insights tailored to specific performance trends.
KPIs are updated in real-time, giving stakeholders immediate access to the latest supplier performance data.
Impact on Supplier Engagement:
Enhanced Visibility: Stakeholders have up-to-the-minute data on supplier performance, allowing them to take quick actions if necessary.
Informed Decision Making: Real-time access to KPIs makes it easier to engage with suppliers based on data, not assumptions.
Proactive Monitoring: Identifies performance issues early, enabling stakeholders to engage suppliers before problems worsen.
